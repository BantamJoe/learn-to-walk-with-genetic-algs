# Learning to walk with genetic algorithms
Learning to walk with genetic algorithms by optimizing a truncated Fourier series, applied to a realistic bio-mechanical model of the human body.

It used the OpenSim environment for biomechanical simulations, modified for the NIPS 2017 "Learning to Run" competition.
